            Diversity and inclusion is a topic that has always interested me, and,
            as I grew up, I became aware of the importance of this subject.
            I had the privilege of being raised by a family that always encouraged me â™¥,
            and I was always able to play with whatever I wanted, regardless of my gender.
            <br /> <br />
            When I got to college, I started to face the discrimination
            that many other girls and women face: being a woman in a technology area.
            So, I thought <span>"what can I do to change this?"</span> and that's how it all started!
            <br /> <br />
            I discovered several projects in Brazil and around the world, which encourage
            the participation of women in technology and I knew I had to be part of it! I started
            being part of many groups of women in technology, going to meetings, and helping other
            women through these groups. But that alone was not enough!
            The inclusion of women and other minorities in technology <b>needs to be done together</b>,
            and I realized that as much as many institutions wanted to help, they did not know how.
            <br /> <br />
            Then I decided to do my 'final college paper' about women in tech and conducted a study
            on the lack of female visibility in the Brazilian technology market. As a result, proposals
            were made on how to make the IT market more inclusive and equal for women and other minorities.
            <br /> <br />
            At the moment, I'm trying to create a booklet with the proposals and soon I'll post it here. :)
